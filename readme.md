# Snake Game (Python Turtle Graphics)

## Description

This is a basic implementation of the Classic Snake Game from the old Nokia mobile phones.

The app was writen using Python, with object orientated programming in mind

Note if you find commented-out print Statements that I did not remove it means I was simply testing something there and did not remove it.
